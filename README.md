# Refined Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams, but better

- Too many Teams and channels ?
- Need to add 100+ people in a channel, *manually* ?

## Features

- Bulk insert users into a Team
- Display teams and channels on 2 columns
- Merge "General" channel into the Team name, if it is alone in a Team
- Reduce font size

For the 2-column display, you need to switch from the "Grid" to the "List" view.
